# FileArchiveInspector
"FileArchiveInspector" is a Python project that allows you to analyze the contents of an archive file. The repository provides a set of files with specific functionalities.
The "logger.py" file handles the execution of the program and writes log messages. The "encrypt.py" program accepts commands through standard input, such as PASSKEY, ENCRYPT, DECRYPT, QUIT, RESULT, and ERROR. Lastly, the "driver.py" program creates two separate processes to execute the logger and encrypt programs.

To run the project, you simply execute the "driver.py" file, enter the desired log file name, and input the necessary commands. Once you have completed your tasks, use the "QUIT" command to exit the program. This project offers a convenient way to inspect files within an archive and understand their purposes.
